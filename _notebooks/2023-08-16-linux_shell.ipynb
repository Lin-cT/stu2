This is a <mark>bash script</mark>, a sequence of commands, that will create a project directory and add the \"project\" from GitHub to the vscode directory.

    "Next, it checks for the existence of the project directory ($project). If the project directory does not exist, the script proceeds to clone the Git repository specified by $project_repo into the project directory. This is accomplished by navigating to the project_dir, performing the Git clone operation, and returning to the home directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the script provides status messages to indicate whether the project directory and repository were created or already existed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this script automates the process of setting up a project directory and cloning a Git repository, ensuring that the necessary directories are created and the repository is cloned only when they are not already present."
