    "    In Class 5, we went deper into algorithms. Here, we learned how to develop algorithms. The purpose of developing algorithms is so that we can automate and simplify repetitive code. In this clas, I think algorithms were explained in a more simple way and it was much easier to understand. We learned that there was more than one way to code an algorithm and still get the same result. They also taught us that algorithms can be used to compute math. They also taught us a way to sort lists using selection sort and insertion sort. \n",
