    "![image](https://files.catbox.moe/n32b1s.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "How They Work:\n",
    "1. Tree Generation- Starts from the root node with the entire dataset. Then, it recursivley splits the dataset into smaller subsets based on the most significant feature at each node. Stops when it reaches a stopping criterion (ex. maximum depth, minimum samples per leaf). \n",
    "- Maximum Depth- Each time a tree splits, it goes down one level. If you set a maximum depth, the tree can only grow a certain amount of levels before it is stopped.\n",
    "- Minimum Samples Per Leaf- When the tree splits, the dataset gets smaller and smaller and the samples (think of them as rows in the dataset). If the criteria is set with a minimum number of samples required for a node to become a leaf (a node without further splits) then nodes with fewer than the minimum number of samples become nodes. \n",
    "1. Decision Making- When making predictions, the algorithm traverses through the tree starting from the root and follows the decision rules at each node (Like for example, is the subject older than 30 years old? Yes or no) based on the data input into the algorithm. Once it reaches a leaf node, it reaches a decision (it reaches a prediction or classification).\n",
    "2. Pruning- Sometimes, branches of a tree are unnecessary, and are removed through several different processes of pruning.\n",
    "- Pre-Pruning- This is implimented during the tree building process, like setting stopping criteria (maximum depth, minimum samples per leaf, etc.)\n",
    "- Post-Pruning- Once a decision tree is fully grown, some branches are selectivley removed if they do not improve the trees performance on validation data. The algorithm iterates over every node and evaluates the effect of removing the node. If it improves validation data, the branch is removed and the previous node becomes a leaf.\n",
