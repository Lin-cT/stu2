    "Me and Bella have decided to focus on developing and innovating our current features on the website. One of the features we saw needed fixing was my personal diary feature, as the cookies on the deployed website did not work, and that was crucial for my program to work. Another feature we wanted to revisit again was the profile feature. Before, Bella was working on creating customizble proflies for the users, allowing them to change profile pictures and edit other things. We are planing on programming and adding this feature as a final adjustment."
