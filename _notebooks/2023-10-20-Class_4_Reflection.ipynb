    "    In Class 4 we learned about different types of algorithms. There are selection algorithms, that make decisions based on circumstances. There are iteration algorithms, aka repitition algorithms. After performing a procedure, it can check to see if it has been completed. Other things we revisted are conditional statements, such as if else statements, which allow the program to make a decision on which code to run based off of conditions. Then, there are loops (for and while) that repeat code. Lastly, they talked about strings which is a data type that is used to represent text. I think this class was the most confusing, as they didn't quite talk much (at least in class) about what an algorithm was, and they just went straight into it. \n",
