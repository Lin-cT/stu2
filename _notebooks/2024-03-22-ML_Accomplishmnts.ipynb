    "Going into this project, I was very unfamiliar with different types of models, besides the model that geneates the database. I was very unsure of how to start the model for machine learning. Yet through help from friends and trial and error, I was able to accomplish creating both a model and an API based off of predicting the liklihood of depresison. \n",

    "I feel like after going through this project, I now have a much better understanding of how models, as well as machine learning, works. While dealing with an issue between the improper tyep of model (linear or regession), I did some research into how the different types of models work. I now have gained some deeper understanding on how each of these models work. \n",

    "Logistic Regression Mdoel:\n",

    "- Uses logistic regression to map input values to a probability score between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "I feel as thoguh I was also able to learn more about organization fo code, as well as documentation of code. With the example of the titantic code provided, I was able to learn how to properly document my code with the use of multi-line comment and single line comments. The multi-line comments were used to iterate through the steps of each function of the machine learning model, and whenever I run the file the comments run and explain how the model works. The single line comments help to better understand what each function and line of code works. "
